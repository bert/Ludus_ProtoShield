[*SparkFun Ludus ProtoShield (DEV-13310)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13310)

This is an Arduino shield that integrates an H-Bridge Driver and breaks out 
all I/O ports to three-pin headers on a GND / PWR / SIG standard. This enables quick
prototyping and integration of Arduino projects w/o the need of a breadboard.

Ludus is the mascot of the SparkFun Education team. It is a highly intelligent, 8-legged (tenacled) octopus.
